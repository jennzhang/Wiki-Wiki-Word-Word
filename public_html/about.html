		      <p class="lead text-muted">Wiki Wiki Word Word is a term project for Oregon State University's Spring 2021 - CS 361 - Software Engineering 1 class.</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">Wiki Wiki Word Word provides a fun way for lovers of trivia and Wikipedia to get their daily dose of Wikipedia. Explore the <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen" target="_blank">Term of the Day</a>, derived from Wikipedia's Featured Article of the Day category, and its relevant Wikipedia pages. For a more custom experience, tinker with the <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen/microservice.html" target="_blank">Wikipedia Search API GUI</a> to discover Wikipedia pages related to a specific search term. For developers, utilize the <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen/microservice.html" target="_blank">API endpoints</a> to incorporate Wiki Wiki Word Word's microservice into your own app.
					</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">In addition to its own very fine inner workings, Wiki Wiki Word Word also incorporates the data from microservices of classmates' projects to drive the functionality of this site!
					</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">The Term of the Day's heading's background picture is a modified image from the image transformer microservice: the original image that is housed locally at <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen/components/olga-tutunaru-JMATuFkXeHU-unsplash.jpg" target="_blank">http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen/components/olga-tutunaru-JMATuFkXeHU-unsplash.jpg</a> is sent to the image transformer microservice with the correct modification dimensions and the microservice sends over the modified/cropped image. This modified image is then saved on the WWWW server at <a href="http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:7765/images/cropped_image.jpg" target="_blank">http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:7765/images/cropped_image.jpg</a> (any older version of the image is written over). Then the image is placed behind the Term of the Day's Header with an opacity of 30%.</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">The Term of the Day is distilled from another classmate's project's microservice, the Today's Featured Article microservice. This microservice sends over useful data for Wikipedia's Today's Featured Article. By following the TFA microservice's daily updated url, WWWW parses through the html of the article and uses another Wikipedia Page as the Term of the Day (through a somewhat arbitrary choosing process). The Term of the Day, along with the link to that page, an image (if exists) for the term, and a short extract of the page (by making a direct call to Wikipedia's api), is populated on the front page.
					</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">Finally, the Relevant Wikipedia Pages are derived by calling the WWWW Wikipedia Search endpoint. The relevant pages are displayed below the Term of the Day in an easy to read format, with links to the pages themselves. WWWW users can enjoy paging through the Term of the Day Wikipedia ecosystem and playing around with the Wikipedia Search endpoint on the <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhangjen/microservice.html" target="_blank">Microservice page</a>, if so desired.
